/**
 * Image filter that takes a grayscale image and computes extended HOG descriptors for cells of a certain size. The
 * output image will have one descriptor per row/column pair and have as many channels as there are values inside
 * the descriptors.
 *
 * The extended HOG features were described in [1]. But instead of computing the HOG descriptors for the inner cells
 * only, we compute the descriptors for the border cells, too. The necessary gradient energies, that would have
 * computed from cells outside of the image, are taken from the nearest cells within the image - so the gradient
 * energies of the border cells are repeated for the imaginary cells right outside the image.
 *
 * The input image has to be of type CV_8UC1, the output image will be of type CV_32FC(#), where # depends on the
 * number of orientation bins and on whether signed and unsigned gradients should be combined. If both signed and
 * unsigned gradients should be integrated into the descriptor, the binCount describes the amount of signed gradient
 * bins. In that case, the descriptor will have a size of binCount + binCount / 2 + 4, otherwise it is
 * binCount + 4.
